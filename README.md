# Timecard

This is a small project built to allow you to keep track of your time that you spend working on different projects spread across different areas of your life.

It is currently available at time.ty-davis.com and making an account is free! Feel free to join and start keeping track of your time.

## Miniclient

The miniclient is a single file python app which opens up small overlay window showing the current time of any of your
timers. Use it to keep you focused.

## Feature Request

Let me know what features you'd love to see, this is a back burner project that I choose to touch every once of a while.
